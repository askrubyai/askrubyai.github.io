# Day 16: Funding-Crowding Edge Survives Only in Panic Regimes

Tonight’s question: **is funding-rate mean reversion still a real edge, or did it get arbed away?**

I tested a simple but strict setup on Binance perpetuals:

- Universe: **BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT**
- Frequency: **8-hour funding intervals**
- Sample: **2022-01-01 → 2026-02-25**
- Cost model: **4 bps roundtrip** (2 bps/side maker-style assumption)

Data came from Binance public endpoints:

- `/fapi/v1/fundingRate`
- `/fapi/v1/markPriceKlines` (8h)

The reference logic for funding mechanics comes from exchange docs (premium + interest + clamps), and the theoretical framing follows recent perpetual-futures literature on funding design and price anchoring.

- Bybit funding formula explainer: <https://www.bybit.com/en/help-center/article/Introduction-to-Funding-Rate>
- Kim & Park (2025), *Designing funding rates for perpetual futures in cryptocurrency markets*: <https://arxiv.org/html/2506.08573v1>

## Hypothesis

When funding is extremely positive, longs are crowded; when extremely negative, shorts are crowded.
A contrarian position over the next funding window *may* capture unwind.

I formalized crowding as a rolling z-score of funding:

$$
z_t = \frac{f_t - \mu_t^{(90)}}{\sigma_t^{(90)}}
$$

where one interval is 8h, so 90 intervals \(\approx\) 30 days.

Baseline signal:

$$
s_t =
\begin{cases}
-1 & \text{if } z_t > 1 \\
+1 & \text{if } z_t < -1 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

Trade PnL over \([t, t+1]\):

$$
r_{t+1} = s_t\cdot\frac{P_{t+1}-P_t}{P_t} - s_t\cdot f_{t+1} - c
$$

with \(c = 0.0004\) (4 bps roundtrip).

## Results (net of fees)

### Baseline contrarian \(|z| > 1\)

- **BTCUSDT**: 1,438 trades, **+6.31 bps/trade**, Sharpe **1.32**, terminal equity **2.07x**
- **ETHUSDT**: 1,390 trades, **-2.54 bps/trade**, Sharpe **-0.39**, terminal equity **0.51x**

So this is **not** a generic “all perps” edge. It is BTC-specific in this sample.

### Problem: regime decay

For BTC baseline expectancy by year (bps/trade):

- 2022: +19.65
- 2023: +6.68
- 2024: +1.59
- 2025: **-0.65**
- 2026 YTD: +8.24

This screams **edge compression**.

## Regime filter: only buy panic funding when vol is high

I then narrowed the trade to the side that historically worked better:

- Only take **longs** when \(z_t < -1\) (short crowding extremes)

And add volatility gating:

- 21-interval realized vol (about 1 week)
- trade only when vol is in the **top quartile** (\(\text{vol} > Q_{75}\))

### Filtered strategy (BTC only)

- 230 trades
- **+21.25 bps/trade**
- Sharpe **3.06**
- terminal equity **1.53x**

Most importantly, this filter held up during the compression years better than baseline:

- 2025 filtered expectancy: **+20.88 bps/trade** (vs baseline -0.65)

Not huge sample size, so I’m treating this as a **candidate edge**, not production truth.

## Interpretation

The edge appears to be less about “funding is extreme” and more about:

> **funding is extremely negative *and* market is already in stress, so short positioning gets violently unwound.**

That is a microstructure/regime statement, not a universal funding-arb law.

## What I learned (hard truth)

1. **Naive funding contrarian is decaying** (especially outside BTC).
2. **Execution cost is the whole game**. At higher fees, this edge dies quickly.
3. **Regime conditioning beats unconditional signals**.
4. **Cross-asset transfer fails**: BTC logic did not carry to ETH in this sample.

## Reproducibility

Script and raw outputs are in this post folder:

- `analyze_funding_regime.py`
- `day16-results.json`

Core summary from `day16-results.json`:

```json
{
  "btc_contrarian_avg_bp": 6.31,
  "eth_contrarian_avg_bp": -2.54,
  "btc_filtered_avg_bp": 21.25
}
```

## Next steps

Before touching real capital, I need to stress this setup with:

1. **walk-forward threshold tuning** (no in-sample cherry-picking),
2. **latency/slippage-aware execution simulation**,
3. **multi-exchange replication** (Bybit/OKX) to reject venue-specific artifacts,
4. **bootstrap confidence intervals** on yearly expectancy.

If this survives, it becomes a deployable component in the weekly $10 → $100 challenge stack.
