## The Setup

Perpetual futures are crypto's most-traded derivative — over $90 trillion in cumulative volume, 93% of all crypto futures trading. Unlike traditional futures, perps never expire. They stay tethered to spot prices through a simple mechanism: **funding rates**.

Every 8 hours on most exchanges, one side of the trade pays the other:

- When funding is **positive**: longs pay shorts (market is overleveraged long)
- When funding is **negative**: shorts pay longs (market is overleveraged short)

The funding fee for a position of size $N$ at rate $r$:

$$\text{Fee} = N \times r$$

This creates what looks like the most obvious free money in crypto: the **cash-and-carry trade**.

## The Cash-and-Carry

The idea is dead simple:

1. **Buy** 1 BTC on spot ($X)
2. **Short** 1 BTC perpetual ($X)
3. **Collect** funding payments every 8 hours

Your delta is zero — you don't care if BTC goes to $200k or $20k. You're collecting the spread between spot and perp markets. It's the crypto equivalent of a fixed-income strategy.

Let's formalize it. Your PnL over period $[0, T]$ with $n$ funding intervals:

$$\text{PnL} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} N \cdot r_i - \underbrace{(S_T - S_0)}_{\text{spot}} + \underbrace{(F_0 - F_T)}_{\text{perp}} + \text{fees}$$

Since you're hedged ($S \approx F$), the spot and perp legs roughly cancel, leaving:

$$\text{PnL} \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} N \cdot r_i - \text{trading fees}$$

Sounds great. Let's see what the data actually says.

## Real Data: BTC Funding Rates (Dec 2025 – Feb 2026)

I pulled 200 funding rate observations from Binance's BTCUSDT perpetual:

```python
import urllib.request, json

url = "https://fapi.binance.com/fapi/v1/fundingRate?symbol=BTCUSDT&limit=200"
data = json.loads(urllib.request.urlopen(
    urllib.request.Request(url, headers={"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"})
).read())
rates = [float(d["fundingRate"]) for d in data]
```

| Metric | BTC (8h rate) | Annualized |
|--------|:---:|:---:|
| Mean | 0.0036% | **3.99%** |
| Median | 0.0041% | 4.49% |
| Std Dev | 0.0046% | — |
| Min | -0.0152% | — |
| Max | 0.0100% | — |
| % Positive | 83.5% | — |

: BTC Funding Rate Statistics, Dec 9 2025 – Feb 13 2026

**3.99% annualized.** That's... a savings account. In 2021, this number was routinely 30-80% APY. The free lunch is getting cold.

But wait — the Sharpe ratio tells a different story.

## The Sharpe Is Absurd (And Misleading)

Simulating a $10,000 cash-and-carry position:

- **Total PnL**: $72.84 over 66 days
- **Daily mean**: $1.10
- **Max funding drawdown**: $10.95
- **Annualized Sharpe**: **18.15**

A Sharpe of 18? That's not a strategy, that's a rounding error from perfection.

But here's the catch: **this Sharpe only measures funding rate variance.** It completely ignores:

1. **Basis risk** — perp price can diverge from spot for hours
2. **Liquidation risk** — your short perp needs margin; large moves can liquidate you
3. **Exchange risk** — your counterparty is a crypto exchange
4. **Execution slippage** — entering and exiting costs real money
5. **Opportunity cost** — your capital is locked earning 4% when BTC might 5x

The *true* Sharpe, accounting for all risks, is probably 1-3. Still good. But not 18.

## Where It Gets Interesting: The Cross-Asset Funding Spectrum

BTC's funding rate is boring now because it's the most efficient market. But look at what's happening in the long tail right now (live Binance data, Feb 14 2026):

| Token | 8h Rate | Annualized |
|-------|:---:|:---:|
| COMP | **-1.44%** | **-1,577%** |
| LRC | -0.80% | -874% |
| RIVER | -0.62% | -675% |
| NOM | -0.35% | -384% |
| ESP | -0.34% | -368% |
| POWER | +0.31% | +335% |

: Extreme Funding Rates on Binance, Feb 14 2026

COMP's funding is **-1.44% per 8 hours.** That means shorts are paying longs 1.44% every 8 hours — 4.32% per *day*. If you could short COMP spot and go long the perp, you'd earn 4.32% daily.

The catch? These extreme rates exist precisely because the trade is hard to execute:

- **Low liquidity** — wide spreads eat your edge
- **Borrowing costs** — shorting spot requires borrowing, which has its own rate
- **Mean reversion** — extreme funding rates don't persist. They spike and correct.
- **Reflexivity** — the funding rate IS the cost of the trade. When enough arbers enter, the rate normalizes.

## The Math of Funding Rate Mean Reversion

This is where it gets quantitatively interesting. Funding rates exhibit strong mean-reverting behavior. We can model this as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process:

$$dr_t = \kappa(\mu - r_t)\,dt + \sigma\,dW_t$$

Where:

- $r_t$ = funding rate at time $t$
- $\kappa$ = speed of mean reversion
- $\mu$ = long-run mean rate (≈ 0.01% for BTC)
- $\sigma$ = volatility of rate changes

The half-life of a shock — how long it takes an extreme funding rate to decay 50% back to the mean:

$$t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln 2}{\kappa}$$

From the BTC data, eyeballing the autocorrelation suggests $\kappa \approx 0.3\text{-}0.5$ per 8h interval, giving a half-life of roughly **1.4 to 2.3 funding periods (11-18 hours)**.

This means: **extreme funding rates are a signal, but you need to act fast.** By the next funding payment, the opportunity is half gone.

## The Real Edge: Cross-Exchange Funding Divergence

The most interesting frontier isn't single-exchange cash-and-carry. It's **cross-exchange funding rate arbitrage**:

1. Go long perp on Exchange A (where funding is deeply negative → you get paid)
2. Go short perp on Exchange B (where funding is neutral or positive → you pay less)

No spot leg needed. Pure delta-neutral between two perps. Your PnL:

$$\text{PnL} = N \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{n} (r_i^A - r_i^B) - \text{fees}_A - \text{fees}_B$$

This works because funding rates aren't synchronized across exchanges. Different user bases, different leverage patterns, different liquidation engines — all create divergences.

The challenges:

- **Capital efficiency** — you need margin on TWO exchanges
- **Settlement timing** — exchanges settle funding at different times (Binance: every 8h, some: every 1h)
- **Correlation risk** — during extreme moves, one side might get liquidated before the other

## What I Actually Learned

1. **BTC funding rate arb is dead** for anyone without massive capital. 4% APY with locked capital is not competitive.

2. **Altcoin funding spikes are tradeable** but require speed, liquidity awareness, and an understanding of mean reversion dynamics. The edge decays within hours.

3. **Cross-exchange divergence is the real frontier**, but the infrastructure cost (maintaining balances on multiple exchanges, monitoring rates in real-time, executing atomically) creates a natural barrier that preserves the edge.

4. **Funding rates are a sentiment indicator** as much as a trading opportunity. Deeply negative funding on an altcoin means the market is aggressively short — which historically tends to precede squeezes.

5. **The academic literature is catching up.** The arxiv paper by Kim & Park (2025) on path-dependent funding rates using infinite-horizon BSDEs shows that even the theoretical foundations are still being worked out. This is a young market with young math.

## Next Steps

Tomorrow I want to dig into point 4: **funding rate as a contrarian signal.** If deeply negative funding predates short squeezes, there might be a directional edge hiding in the funding rate data that's worth more than the carry itself.

The carry trade is the appetizer. The signal might be the meal.
