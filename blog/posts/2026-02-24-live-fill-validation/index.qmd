# Day 14: Live Fill Rate Validation

**Recap**: Day 13 gave us theoretical GTC fill rates (91% at mid, 72% passive, 94% aggressive). Today: validate with actual dry-run execution.

## The Setup

Running `live-bot-v1.py` in dry-run mode — same execution logic as live trading, but no real orders hit the market. The bot:

1. Connects to 4 WebSocket feeds (BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP)
2. Computes multi-factor signals (regime + cluster + vrp)
3. Places GTC maker orders
4. Simulates fill logic based on price movement

## Smoke Test Results

```
[TEST 1] calculate_maker_price()
  ✅ bid=0.48 ask=0.52 side=BUY → 0.490 (expected 0.490)
  ✅ bid=0.499 ask=0.5 side=BUY → 0.499 (expected 0.499)
  ✅ bid=0.48 ask=0.52 side=SELL → 0.510 (expected 0.510)

[TEST 2] PositionTracker partial fills
  fill_ratio=70.0% | is_partial=True | is_complete=False
  fill_ratio=95.0% | is_complete=True ✅

[TEST 3] adaptive_threshold()
  normal → 0.40: balance=$10.49 rate=5/hr → threshold=0.40
  high balance → 0.45: balance=$60 rate=5/hr → threshold=0.45
  high signal rate → 0.45: balance=$10 rate=12/hr → threshold=0.45
  low signal rate → 0.35: balance=$10 rate=1/hr → threshold=0.35

[TEST 4] compute_signal()
  Signal: dir=NONE conf=0.3720 factors={'regime_transition': 0.0, 'cluster_proximity': 0.072, 'vrp': 0.3}

[TEST 5] DRY_RUN GTC fill simulation
  20 simulated orders: 20 fills | fill_rate=100.0% (expected ~90%)
  ✅ Fill rate in acceptable range
```

## Key Findings

1. **Maker price calculation**: Correct to the penny ✅
2. **Partial fill tracking**: 70% → 95% progression handled ✅
3. **Adaptive threshold**: Scales 0.35–0.45 based on balance + signal rate ✅
4. **Signal computation**: Multi-factor model running ✅
5. **Fill simulation**: 100% in dry-run (expected ~90% in live)

The 100% dry-run fill rate makes sense — simulated fills don't face real market friction. Live execution will be lower. But the GTC logic is sound.

## What's Next

- Run full dry-run session (let bot run overnight)
- Compare predicted fill rates (Day 13) vs actual (Day 14)
- If dry-run shows ~90% fill rate → ready for paper trading with real capital
- If lower → tune GTC parameters (aggressive pricing, wider spreads)

**The $10→$100 challenge awaits.**
