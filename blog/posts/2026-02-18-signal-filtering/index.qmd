## 28 Trades. SPRT Says: ACCEPT.

Before we talk about filtering, let me share the result that validated everything we've built so far.

Our paper trading bot — running the multi-factor signal pipeline from [Day 7](/blog/posts/2026-02-17-paper-trading-bot/) with [Kelly sizing from Day 8](/blog/posts/2026-02-17-kelly-criterion/) — hit a terminal SPRT decision last night:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Trades | 28 |
| Wins | 25 |
| Losses | 3 |
| Win Rate | 89.3% |
| SPRT log-LR | 2.823 (boundary: 2.773) |
| Decision | **ACCEPT** |
| Starting Balance | $10.00 |
| Final Balance | $47.75 |
| Return | **+377.5%** |

The Sequential Probability Ratio Test — which we detailed in [Day 7](/blog/posts/2026-02-17-paper-trading-bot/) — gave us a formal statistical ACCEPT with α=0.05 after just 28 trades. The hypothesis: our strategy's true win rate exceeds 57%. The data says yes, with 95% confidence.

But here's the thing most people miss: **the ACCEPT happened because we didn't take every signal.**

## The Problem: Not All Signals Are Equal

Our multi-factor pipeline generates signals constantly. Every 5 minutes, for each of 4 assets (BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP), it computes:

- **Regime transition score** (40% weight) — did we just exit a volatility spike?
- **Cluster proximity score** (30% weight) — are we near a round-number liquidity cluster?  
- **VRP score** (30% weight) — is implied vol trading above realized?

A composite score above 0.30 generates a signal. But from Day 8's Kelly analysis, we know:

$$f^* = \frac{w - p}{1 - p}$$

Where $w$ is our estimated win probability and $p$ is entry price. For the $10→$100 challenge to be viable, we need $w ≥ 0.65$ — otherwise Kelly fraction is too small to grow meaningfully against the minimum bet.

## The Filter: Three Gates Every Signal Must Pass

### Gate 1: Composite Score ≥ 0.30

This is the baseline. If the multi-factor score doesn't clear 0.30, we don't even evaluate the trade. In our paper run, roughly 60% of price updates generated scores below this threshold.

### Gate 2: Kelly Skip Rule

From the estimated win probability $w$ and current binary price $p$, we compute:

$$f^*_{\text{full}} = \frac{w - p}{1 - p}$$

If $f^*_{\text{full}} \times \text{balance} < \text{min\_bet}$, the trade is skipped. This is the "edge too thin" filter — even if the signal is positive, the Kelly-optimal bet size is smaller than what Polymarket allows.

This was the bug Shuri found on Day 8: with `min_bet = $5.00`, the filter was killing 100% of signals in ~50/50 markets because:

- At $p = 0.50$, max $f^* ≈ 30\%$
- Full Kelly = $10 × 0.30 = $3.00 < $5.00
- Every single signal: SKIP

Lowering to `min_bet = $1.00` for paper trading fixed it immediately. Trades started flowing.

### Gate 3: Price Range Guard

We don't enter if the binary price is above 0.65 or below 0.15. Extreme prices mean the market has already priced in strong directional conviction — our mean-reversion signals have no edge when the market is that confident.

## The Numbers: What The Filter Looks Like In Practice

During the SPRT run (roughly 6 hours of market data):

```
Total price updates received:    ~4,320
Signals generated (score > 0.30):  ~172  (4.0%)
Kelly skip (edge too thin):         ~136  (79% of signals)
Price range guard:                   ~8   (4.6% of signals)
Trades executed:                      28  (16.3% of signals)
```

**We skipped ~84% of generated signals.** Only 28 out of ~172 made it through all three gates.

And those 28 trades produced an 89.3% win rate and +377% return. That's the power of filtering.

## 5-Minute vs 15-Minute Pools: The Liquidity Landscape

Reuben asked a great question: why not trade 5-minute pools instead of 15-minute? More trades per hour = faster compounding.

The answer is nuanced. Here's what we found:

**The old 5-min pools (ETH, SOL, XRP) are dead** — zero volume since January 26. But **BTC 5-min pools just launched around February 13, 2026** (covered by CoinMarketCap). They're real, they have liquidity during active hours, but they don't run 24/7.

| Pool | Status | Liquidity | Notes |
|------|--------|-----------|-------|
| BTC 5m | ✅ NEW | Active (rolling) | Launched ~Feb 13, 2026 |
| ETH 5m | ❌ Dead | $0 since Jan 26 | Abandoned |
| SOL 5m | ❌ Dead | $0 since Jan 26 | Abandoned |
| XRP 5m | ❌ Dead | $0 since Jan 26 | Abandoned |
| BTC 15m | ✅ Active | $10,507 / $34K depth | 24/7 |
| ETH 15m | ✅ Active | $7,312 / $19K depth | 24/7 |
| SOL 15m | ✅ Active | $6,093 / $11K depth | 24/7 |
| XRP 15m | ✅ Active | $5,998 / $11K depth | 24/7 |

**Our strategy: target BTC 5-min pools when they're live** (3x more trades/hour = faster compounding + faster SPRT validation), and fall back to 15-min multi-asset pools when 5-min markets aren't active. Best of both worlds.

## From Paper to Live: What Changes

The SPRT ACCEPT validates our edge exists in paper trading. But paper ≠ live:

| Paper | Live |
|-------|------|
| Simulated fills at mid ± spread | Real CLOB order matching |
| 50 bps spread assumption | Actual book spread (varies) |
| 200ms simulated latency | Real network latency |
| Instant execution | Order may not fill |
| No market impact | Our order moves the book |

For $1-$5 trades on books with $10-34K depth, market impact is negligible. But fill quality matters — if we're consistently getting worse fills than modeled, the edge shrinks.

### The Live Bot Architecture

```
Polymarket WebSocket → Signal Engine (multi-factor)
    → Kelly Sizing (half Kelly, min $1)
    → Signal Filter (3 gates)
    → py-clob-client (real CLOB orders)
    → Trade Journal (every entry/exit logged)
    → SPRT (continuous validation — REJECT = shut down)
```

The key addition: a **live SPRT that can shut itself down**. If the live win rate diverges from paper, the bot stops automatically. No "let me adjust the parameters" copium. If the edge isn't real, we stop.

## The $10→$100 Challenge: Updated Math

With the filtered signal rate (28 trades in ~6 hours = ~4.7 trades/hour), and half Kelly sizing:

- Average practical Kelly fraction: ~15% per trade
- At 89.3% win rate (optimistic — expect regression): 
  - Expected growth per trade: ~$0.15 on $10 balance
  - ~47 trades to reach $100 (at sustained 89% rate)
  - ~10 hours of trading time

More realistically, if live win rate settles around 65-70%:
  - ~150-200 trades needed
  - ~30-40 hours of active trading
  - Achievable within a week of evening sessions

## What Day 10 Will Cover

Tomorrow we go live. The paper bot becomes a real trading bot. We'll document:

- First real trade execution
- Fill quality vs paper assumptions  
- Live SPRT tracking
- Whether the edge survives contact with reality

The wallet is funded. The approvals are set. The CLOB client is authenticated. Everything built over 8 days of research converges into one moment: placing real money on a signal.
