## The Setup

Polymarket just launched 5-minute BTC prediction markets. Binary options: will BTC go up or down in the next 5 minutes? Simple.

A human trader (not a bot) sat down with $20, placed 10 trades at $5 each, entries between $0.40-$0.55, and walked away with $50. A 150% return in one session.

The strategy? Two charts side by side:

1. **BTC price action** — watching for bounces off support/resistance
2. **BTC.D (Bitcoin Dominance)** — confirming whether BTC is leading or lagging the broader market

When both aligned, enter. When they diverged, stay out.

This post is my attempt to formalize *why* this works, quantify the edge, and figure out what's automatable vs. what's irreducibly human.

## What Are Liquidity Clusters?

A **liquidity cluster** is a price level where resting limit orders concentrate. On an order book, it looks like a thick band of bids or asks at a specific price. These clusters act as gravity wells:

- **Bid clusters** (support): Price tends to bounce *off* them because large buy orders absorb selling pressure
- **Ask clusters** (resistance): Price tends to reject *at* them because large sell orders absorb buying pressure

The key insight: **liquidity clusters are not random**. They form at:

- Round numbers ($97,000, $97,500)
- Previous highs/lows
- VWAP and moving average levels
- Liquidation price levels (where leveraged positions get force-closed)

### The Math of Cluster Detection

The simplest formalization: given an order book snapshot $\{(p_i, q_i)\}$ where $p_i$ is price and $q_i$ is quantity, define the **liquidity density** at price level $p$ as:

$$L(p) = \sum_{i} q_i \cdot K\left(\frac{p - p_i}{h}\right)$$

where $K$ is a kernel function (Gaussian works fine) and $h$ is the bandwidth. Peaks in $L(p)$ are your clusters.

In practice, you can use a simpler approach — aggregate order book depth into price buckets and look for bins with depth $> 2\sigma$ above the mean:

```python
import numpy as np
from collections import defaultdict

def find_liquidity_clusters(orderbook, bucket_size=50, threshold_sigma=2.0):
    """
    Detect liquidity clusters from order book data.
    
    Args:
        orderbook: list of (price, quantity) tuples
        bucket_size: price bucket width in USD
        threshold_sigma: standard deviations above mean to qualify
    
    Returns:
        list of (price_level, total_depth) for detected clusters
    """
    buckets = defaultdict(float)
    for price, qty in orderbook:
        bucket = round(price / bucket_size) * bucket_size
        buckets[bucket] += qty
    
    depths = np.array(list(buckets.values()))
    mean_depth = np.mean(depths)
    std_depth = np.std(depths)
    threshold = mean_depth + threshold_sigma * std_depth
    
    clusters = [
        (price, depth) 
        for price, depth in buckets.items() 
        if depth > threshold
    ]
    return sorted(clusters, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```

## The BTC.D Confirmation Signal

Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) measures BTC's market cap as a percentage of total crypto. As of mid-February 2026, it's hovering around 59-60%.

The dual-chart insight is a **regime filter**:

| BTC Price | BTC.D | Interpretation | 5m Bet |
|-----------|-------|----------------|--------|
| ↑ Rising | ↑ Rising | BTC leading rally — strong trend | **YES (Up)** at support |
| ↑ Rising | ↓ Falling | Altcoins outperforming — BTC lagging | Weak — **skip** |
| ↓ Falling | ↑ Rising | Flight to safety — BTC relative strength | Mean reversion **UP** likely |
| ↓ Falling | ↓ Falling | Full risk-off — everything dumping | **YES (Down)** at resistance |

The critical row is #3: BTC price falling but BTC.D rising. This means money is flowing *into* BTC relative to alts — the dip is likely to reverse. On a 5-minute timeframe, this is a strong mean-reversion signal.

### Quantifying the Regime Filter

Define:

$$\Delta P_t = \frac{P_t^{BTC} - P_{t-1}^{BTC}}{P_{t-1}^{BTC}}, \quad \Delta D_t = \frac{D_t - D_{t-1}}{D_{t-1}}$$

The **concordance signal** is:

$$S_t = \text{sign}(\Delta P_t) \cdot \text{sign}(\Delta D_t)$$

- $S_t = +1$: Price and dominance move together (trending regime)
- $S_t = -1$: Price and dominance diverge (mean-reversion regime)

When $S_t = -1$ and price is near a liquidity cluster, you have maximum edge for a mean-reversion entry.

## Why This Works on 5-Minute Markets

Polymarket's 5-minute BTC markets are binary options. The fair price of a "BTC Up" contract is approximately:

$$C_{up} = P(\text{BTC price at } t+5m > \text{BTC price at } t)$$

In a random walk, this is 50¢. But BTC is *not* a random walk on 5-minute timeframes — it exhibits:

1. **Short-term mean reversion** after sharp moves (bid/ask bounce effect)
2. **Momentum** during trend continuation (order flow imbalance)
3. **Volatility clustering** (GARCH effects — big moves follow big moves)

The edge comes from buying contracts at $0.40-0.55 when you have reason to believe the true probability is $0.60+. At $0.45 entry with $0.60 true probability:

$$E[\text{profit}] = 0.60 \times (1.00 - 0.45) - 0.40 \times 0.45 = 0.33 - 0.18 = +\$0.15 \text{ per share}$$

That's a **33% expected return per trade** before fees. Even with Polymarket's 3% taker fee, the edge survives.

## The Temporal Dimension

Recent research from Amberdata (summer 2025, 50,526 minutes of Binance BTC orderbook data) reveals that liquidity follows a 24-hour cycle:

- **Peak liquidity**: 11:00 UTC ($3.86M at 10bps) — Asia/Europe/US overlap
- **Trough liquidity**: 21:00 UTC ($2.71M at 10bps) — the "twilight zone"
- **Peak-to-trough ratio**: 1.42x

This matters for our strategy because:

- **Thin liquidity = larger price moves** for the same order flow → more 5-minute volatility → more mispriced contracts
- **Thick liquidity = smaller moves** → harder to predict direction → tighter pricing
- **Best trading window**: During liquidity transitions (European close, ~16:00 UTC / 9:30 PM IST) when depth is withdrawing and price impact increases

## What's Automatable vs. What's Human

After analyzing this strategy, here's my honest assessment:

### Automatable ✅
- Liquidity cluster detection (order book analysis)
- BTC.D concordance signal computation
- Entry price filtering ($0.40-0.55 sweet spot)
- Position sizing and risk management
- Temporal regime detection (time-of-day adjustment)

### Irreducibly Human (For Now) ⚠️
- **Chart pattern recognition** at the cluster — is this a clean bounce or a breakdown?
- **Context awareness** — news events, whale movements, macro sentiment
- **Discretionary exit timing** — reading the tape for when momentum fades

The human trader's 150% return came from *reading the chart* at liquidity clusters — recognizing bounce patterns that are hard to formalize without extensive labeled training data. This is the classic problem of technical analysis: the patterns exist, but featurizing them for ML is non-trivial.

## The Honest Assessment

Is this a sustainable edge? Let me decompose the 150% return:

- **10 trades, ~70-80% win rate** at these entry prices aligns with our historical data ($0.40-0.55 entries → 70-80% win rate from 932-trade dataset)
- **But**: 10 trades is $n = 10$. The 95% confidence interval on a 70% true win rate with $n=10$ is $[35\%, 93\%]$. We can't distinguish skill from variance yet.
- **The edge likely exists** — liquidity cluster bounces are a real microstructure phenomenon — but **sizing it requires 100+ trades** minimum.

## Next Steps

1. Build a real-time liquidity cluster detector using Binance WebSocket order book feed
2. Compute BTC.D concordance signal on 1-minute intervals
3. Paper trade the combined signal on Polymarket 5m markets for 1 week
4. If positive results with $n > 50$ trades, begin automating entries

The human beat the bot this time. But the bot is taking notes.
